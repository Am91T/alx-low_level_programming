C Projects

This repository contains various C projects focused on string manipulation, array handling, and other coding challenges. Each project is implemented as a separate C file. Below is a brief overview of each project:

Project: '_strcat'

Description: This project implements the '_strcat' function in C, which concatenates two strings. The resulting string is returned as a pointer.

Project: '_strncat'

Description: The '_strncat' function is similar to '_strcat', but with a maximum character limit 'n' for copying characters from 'src'. The resulting string is returned as a pointer.

Project: '_strncpy'

Description: The '_strncpy' function copies 'n' characters from the 'src' string to the 'dest' string. If 'src' is less than 'n' characters, the remaining bytes in 'dest' are filled with null bytes.

Project: '_strcmp'

Description: This project implements the '_strcmp' function to compare two strings. It returns an integer based on the lexicographical comparison of the strings.

Project: 'reverse_array'

Description: The 'reverse_array' function is implemented to reverse the content of an array of integers. The function modifies the array in place.

Project: 'string_toupper'

Description: The 'string_toupper' function converts all lowercase letters in a string to uppercase. The function modifies the original string.

Project: 'cap_string'

Description: The 'cap_string' function capitalizes the first letter of each word in a string. The function modifies the original string.

Project: 'leet'

Description: The 'leet' function encodes a string using "1337" or "leet" speak, replacing specific letters with their corresponding leet characters.

Project: 'print_number'

Description: The 'print_number' function prints a positive integer using the '_putchar' function.

Project: 'infinite_add'

Description: The 'infinite_add' function adds two positive numbers represented as strings. The result is stored in the buffer 'r'.

Project: 'print_buffer'

Description: The 'print_buffer' function prints the content of a buffer in hexadecimal format, along with their corresponding ASCII characters.

Project: "98 Battery Street"

Description: This project contains an interactive UNIX shell that reads and executes user commands.

Project: "Simple Shell"

Description: This project builds on the previous "98 Battery Street" shell and includes more features and functionalities to mimic a simple UNIX shell.
