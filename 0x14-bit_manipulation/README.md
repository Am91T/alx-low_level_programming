# Binary Manipulation Projects

This repository contains a series of C programming projects focused on binary manipulation. Each project implements specific functions that perform various binary operations. The projects are developed following the guidelines provided in the task descriptions.

## Project List

1. **Binary to Unsigned Int Conversion**: This project contains a function `binary_to_uint` that converts a binary number represented as a string into an unsigned integer.

2. **Print Binary Representation**: This project implements the `print_binary` function, which prints the binary representation of a given unsigned long integer without using arrays or the % or / operators.

3. **Get Bit Value**: The `get_bit` function in this project allows you to retrieve the value of a specific bit at a given index within an unsigned long integer.

4. **Set Bit to 1**: The `set_bit` function sets the value of a bit at a given index to 1 within an unsigned long integer.

5. **Clear Bit to 0**: This project's `clear_bit` function sets the value of a bit at a given index to 0 within an unsigned long integer.

6. **Flip Bit Count**: The `flip_bits` function calculates the number of bits that need to be flipped to transform one unsigned long integer into another.

7. **Endianness Checker**: This project provides the `get_endianness` function to determine whether the system is little endian (returns 1) or big endian (returns 0).

8. **Password Crackme**: The `crackme3` program in this project checks if a provided password matches the expected password. You can use the `101-password` file to input the password.
