Project Name: Recursion

Description:

This project focuses on implementing various functions using recursion in the C programming language. The goal is to understand and practice recursion, while adhering to strict coding guidelines (Betty style) and constraints (no loops, no standard library functions, no global variables, etc.).

List of Functions:

_puts_recursion: Prints a string followed by a new line using recursion.

_print_rev_recursion: Prints a string in reverse using recursion.

_strlen_recursion: Returns the length of a string using recursion.

_pow_recursion: Returns the value of x raised to the power of y using recursion.

_sqrt_recursion: Returns the natural square root of a number using recursion.

factorial: Returns the factorial of a given number using recursion.

is_prime_number: Checks if a number is prime using recursion.

is_palindrome: Checks if a string is a palindrome using recursion.

wildcmp: Compares two strings and returns 1 if they can be considered identical, otherwise returns 0, using recursion.
